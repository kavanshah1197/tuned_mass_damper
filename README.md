# Background and Motivation
Throughout history, humans have built impressive structures and cities only for them to encounter the forces of nature.Earthquakes are one of the Earth’s most destructive forces — the seismic waves throughout the ground can destroy buildings, take lives, and costs tremendous amounts of money for loss and repair.
According to the National Earthquake Information Center, there is an average of 20,000 earthquakes each year —16 of them being major disasters. As with the case with most earthquakes, the damage was not caused by the quake itself but by the collapse of buildings with people inside them, making earthquake-proof buildings a must.
